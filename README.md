How to set up your environment
Prerequisites: openjdk-11-jdk, wildfly application Server v22.final
Install and configure the wildfly server using the article at the end of this link :
https://vitux.com/install-and-configure-wildfly-jboss-on-ubuntu/

When done, set up your application's file management folder. 
Go to the wildfly installation folder and add a "footstats" folder.
This folder MUST contain two other folders: tmp, uploads. 
Then give ownership of this folder to user and group wildfly

Deploy n Enjoy !
